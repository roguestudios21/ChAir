# ChAir

**ChAir** (short for **Chat Over Air**) is a privacy-focused, offline-capable iOS chat app that allows users to anonymously communicate with nearby peers over the local network using **Multipeer Connectivity**. Designed with simplicity and security in mind, ChAir requires **no internet access** and shares **no personal data**.

Built entirely with **SwiftUI** and leveraging **Apple's MultipeerConnectivity framework**, ChAir is perfect for quick and secure local conversations in hackathons, classrooms, conferences, or events.

##  App Architecture

### WelcomePage

- Entry screen with a minimal welcome message and an `X` button to dismiss onboarding.
- Background uses full-screen image (`Image("welcomePage")`) with glassmorphism-styled button for consistent iOS 26 aesthetics.

### MainPage

- Each user is granted a Random Username 
- Allows the user to select from predefined chat rooms (e.g. "General Chat", "Random", etc.).
- Tapping a room name initializes the peer session and navigates to `ChatRoomView`.
- Also shows all the available peers in the network
- Tapping a peer username initializes the peer session and navigates to `PrivateChatView`.
- Background images and UI styling are consistent with the rest of the app.

### ChatRoomView

- Displays the actual chat session.
- Shows connected peers, messages exchanged, and live chat updates.
- A dark-textured background ensures visibility of chat bubbles.
- UI consists of:
  - A `ScrollView` for showing messages
  - A `TextField` for message input
  - A `Send` button with animation feedback

When two users join the same room on the same Wi-Fi or Bluetooth range, they automatically connect and can chat instantly.

---

### PrivateChatView

- Allows users to initiate and participate in **one-on-one private chats**
- List of connected peers shown; tapping one starts a direct session
- Uses dedicated Multipeer sessions separate from group chats
- Messages are:
  - Private and encrypted within session
  - Auto-deleted once the session ends
- View hierarchy is similar to `ChatRoomView`, but only the selected peer is connected

### Message Bubble View

- Bubbles adjust alignment based on sender (self vs peer).
- Uses SwiftUI's `HStack` and dynamic color schemes.
- Supports smooth animation for incoming/outgoing messages.

---

### MultipeerManager

- Core engine for all peer discovery, session handling, and message exchange
- Supports both group and private sessions
- Stores messages in `messagesByRoom` dictionary for each room
- Sends and receives data using `Codable` messages
- Handles lifecycle:
  - Peer discovery
  - Invitations
  - Session state monitoring
  - Disconnect events and cleanup

##  Privacy & Security

- **No user data is stored**â€”everything is in-memory and session-based.
- **Messages are deleted automatically** when a user exits the app or leaves the network.
- Peer names are randomized and session-based to ensure anonymity.
- **No signup or authentication required**
- **Private chats use isolated sessions**, disconnected from group sessions

---

##  UI/UX & Styling

- Uses SwiftUI 3/4 with glass-like blur effects
- Custom padding, rounded shapes, and SF Symbols
- Consistent design between `ChatRoomView` and `PrivateChatView`
- Designed with iOS 26 UI in mind:
  - Card overlays
  - Vibrant backgrounds
  - Tap/scroll animations

---

##  Testing Notes

To test on **TestFlight**:
- Install the app on **two physical devices**
- Ensure both are on the **same Wi-Fi** or **have Bluetooth enabled**
- Accept permission prompts for **Bluetooth**, **Local Network**, and **Nearby Devices**
